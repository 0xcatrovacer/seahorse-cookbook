# Welcome to Solana ft. Seahorse Cookbook

Over the years Solana has become one of the blockchains with an incredible developer community, and Seahorse Cookbook wishes to take the community forward through these tutorials.

If you have absolutely no idea about Solana and don't have a clue what's going on, I would recommend going through a few resources before you start this. Dirty your hands a little bit, and then dive right back in!

For that I will give you a few resources:

-   the [Solana Cookbook](https://solanacookbook.com/)
-   the [Build a Solana Web3 Dapp](https://buildspace.so/p/build-solana-web3-app) tutorial by Buildspace
-   [Ground Zero](https://groundzero.superteam.fun/) by Superteam

Great now you have some basic context on Solana, let's dive in deeper.
